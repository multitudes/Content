There is a ew framework: Swift Charts. Swift Charts is a flexible framework for making Apple-designed charts.

- Declarative, Compositional, like SwiftUI
- requires `import Charts` to use

Data surrounds us and provides an unprecedented resource for understanding the world and making better decisions. To make data useful, we must make sense of it.

Introducing the sample app about a pop-up pancake food truck sales.

The truck serves an international variety of sweet and savory pancakes like cachapa, injera, crêpe, jian bing, dosa, or American pancakes.

The food truck served more than 4500 pancakes across these styles in the last 30 days. Cachapa were the most popular and the app already shows the most important information in the title.

We add a chart to show a detailed breakdown for the six pancakes.

In Swift Charts, we build charts by composition. The main components of a bar chart are the bars, which are visual elements for each item in your data. Swift Charts calls these visual elements "marks."

## Chart

- `Chart` is the main outside wrapper
- `BarMark` with `x` and `y` positions and `.value` data
- first argument of value is description, second the value

In Xcode we start with adding a chart. To make a bar, we add a BarMark inside the Chart. To show a bar for the number of cachapas, we have to set the name and the sales.

We set the x-position of the bar to be derived from the value of the name of pancake -- in this case "Cachapa." The first argument to the .value factory method is the description of the value, and the second is the value itself. 

```swift
import Charts 
import SwiftUI

struct StylesDetailsChart: View {
	var body: some View {
		Chart {
			BarMark(
				x: .value("Name", "Cachapa")
				y: .value("Sales", 916)
			BarMark(
				x: .value("Name", "Injera"),
				y: .value("Sales", 850)
			)
		}
	}
}
```

![Swift Charts][charts3]

- make data types `Identifiable` to use in `Charts`
- supports `ForEach` for `Identifiable` data collections
- Implicit `forEach` via a `Chart` initializer taking a data collection
- Charts chooses an appropriate visualization automatically
- Adapts to dynamic type, device sizes, orientations, dark mode and supports accessibility automatically

## Features

- When navigation charts in VoiceOver speaks the description + value
- Supports AudioGraph feature from 2021, too (peep sounds)
- .value also accepts a `unit` for types like `Date`, e.g. `.day`
- Supports SwiftUI animations (e.g. animate between different data collections but same bar chart view)
- Use `.foregroundStyle(by:` to group data by color → auto-generated legend for the colors
- Easy to change from `BarMark` to `PointMark` or `LineMark` (great for prototyping charts!)
- Also `.symbol(by:` a value available to use square/circle instead of color to differentiate data form each other
- Marks: Bar, Point, Line
- Mark Properties: X Position, Y Position, Foreground Style, Symbol
